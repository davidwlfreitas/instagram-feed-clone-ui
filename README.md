Instagram Feed Clone UI

An Instagram Feed Clone UI app using [vue-native](https://vue-native.io/), [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/),  [expo](https://docs.expo.io/) and [nativebase](https://nativebase.io/).

## System Requirements

 - Globally installed node >= 6.0
 - Globally installed npm or yarn
 - Globally installed Expo CLI

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/davidwlfreitas/instagram-feed-clone-ui.git
    $ cd instagram-feed-clone-ui


Install project dependencies with npm or yarn:

    $ npm install
or

    $ yarn


## Running the App


    $ npm run start
or

    $ yarn start


### Alternatively, you can start the app directly on platform simulators:
#### iOS

    $ npm run ios
or

    $ yarn ios

This works just like start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if youâ€™re on a Mac and have it installed.

#### Android

    $ npm run android
or

    $ yarn android

This works just like start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. It requires an installation of Android build tools (see the React Native docs for detailed setup).
