# :rocket: Features

# :computer: System Requirements

 - Globally installed node >= 6.0

 - Globally installed Expo CLI
 - Globally installed JSON Server

# :construction_worker: Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/davidwlfreitas/instagram-feed-clone-ui.git
    $ cd instagram-feed-clone-ui


Install project dependencies with npm or yarn:

    $ npm install
or

    $ yarn

## :satellite: Running a Mock API


    $ json-server --host YOUR_IP --watch server.json

## :electric_plug: Integrating Mock API to the App

    To integrate the mock API to the app you just have to add your IP again on ~/settings/index.js 

# :tophat: Running the App


    $ npm run start
or

    $ yarn start


## Alternatively, you can start the app directly on platform simulators:
### iOS

    $ npm run ios
or

    $ yarn ios

This works just like start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if youâ€™re on a Mac and have it installed.

### Android

    $ npm run android
or

    $ yarn android

This works just like start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. It requires an installation of Android build tools (see the React Native docs for detailed setup).
